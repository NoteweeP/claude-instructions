- Suggest possible factors affecting sales variations"
```

### 2. Text Analysis
```
Bad: "What do you think about this article?"

Good: "Please analyze this research article on renewable energy, focusing on:
1. The main hypotheses and findings

3. Potential implications for policy makers
4. Areas that need further research"
```

## Coding Examples

### 1. Function Development
```
Bad: "Write a sorting function."

Good: "Please write a Python function that implements merge sort with:
- Handle both numeric and string inputs
- Include error handling for invalid inputs
- Add comments explaining the algorithm's steps
- Include a simple example of usage"
```

### 2. Code Review
```
Bad: "Is this code good?"

Good: "Please review this Python script that processes customer data:
- Check for potential security vulnerabilities
- Suggest performance improvements
- Identify any maintainability issues
- Recommend best practices for error handling"
```

## Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Specificity**
   - Include concrete details
   - Specify format, length, or style requirements
   - Define the target audience

2. **Context**
   - Provide relevant background information
   - Explain the purpose of the request
   - Include any constraints or limitations

3. **Structured Requests**
   - Break down complex requests into steps
   - Use numbered lists or bullet points
   - Clearly separate different aspects

## Common Patterns

1. **Format Specification**
   ```
   Please [action] in [format] with [specific requirements]
   Example: "Please analyze the data in a bullet-point format with charts for key metrics"
   ```

2. **Audience Definition**
   ```
   Create [content] for [specific audience] with [characteristics]
   Example: "Create a guide for junior developers with 1-2 years of experience"
   ```

3. **Purpose Clarification**
   ```
   Help me [action] to achieve [specific goal] by [method]
   Example: "Help me optimize this code to improve performance by identifying bottlenecks"
   ```

Remember that these examples are templates that can be adapted to your specific needs. The key is to be clear, specific, and provide enough context for Claude to understand your requirements fully.
